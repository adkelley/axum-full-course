# Rust Axum Full Course - Web Development

This is my implementation of the full course from Jeremy Chone for the Axum web development framework in Rust published on his [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@JeremyChone). The Axum framework is built on top of the hyper HTTP library. It is a very fast and efficient framework built on top of the async/await syntax in Rust. This course will cover everything you need to know to get started with Axum and build web applications in Rust.
